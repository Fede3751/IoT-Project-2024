FAQ:

Is the position of the sensors known?

- Sensors can either move deterministically or randomly. In the case of a deterministic movement the balloons know the positions of the sensors at any time. In the case of random movements you can assume that the area is partitioned and each sensor has its own fixed responsibility region.
Any more sophisticated movement algorithm is welcome.
